/**
 * This package contains a set of tests for the classes in 
 * uk.ac.aber.movies. 
 * 
 * There are test classes for each of the main classes: Customer, 
 * Movie and Transaction. No tests are provided for the enumerations
 * that are used in the application code. 
 * 
 * The tests classes can be run individually. Alternatively, the 
 * class TestCustomerMovieTransactions is setup as a JUnit test suite. 
 * If you look at the class definition, you will see some JUnit syntax
 * that takes a simple class and uses it as a way to run all of the 
 * other tests in this package. You can run that class and it has the 
 * effect of running all tests in the other three classes.
