## About this code
The code in this repository is an evolution of the example for Movie Rentals in Chapter 1 of the [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) book by Martin Fowler. Some of the Java syntax has been updated and tests have been added. Further, the example has been changed from just rentals to allow purchases too, aiming to represent an online store. The concept of High Definition and Standard Definition movies has also been included.
