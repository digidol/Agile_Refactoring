# Refactoring AberMovies
This code is used in an exercise on the module CS31310 Agile Methodologies. This repository contains code for the three different tools available on the machines in the IMPACS rooms on campus.

* Eclipse - Avilable on macOS and Windows
* IntelliJ - Available on Linux, macOS and Windows
* Netbeans - Available on Linux, macOS and Windows

Choose the project type that you prefer working with. The code within the projects is the same.

For the purposes of the practical, it is recommended that you use one of the above projects. This will allow you to focus on the task of refactoring.

If you prefer to work at the command line, you will need to download JUnit. We are using JUnit 4.12 on this project. JUnit 5 is available, but the code has not been checked with JUnit 5. It is recommended that you use JUnit 4.
