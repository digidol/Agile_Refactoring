# Refactoring AberMovies
This code is used in an exercise on the module on Agile Development. 

The scenario is discussed in class at the start of the exercise. This code represents the initial code that you should work with during that exercise. The worksheet will discuss the changes you make using refactoring steps. 

The code is arranged into two packages: 

* uk.ac.aber.movies - The extract of code from the application that represents code that will be changed. 
* uk.ac.aber.movies.tests - The tests for the code in the other package. 

The exercise sheet available to the students will explain what to do in the workshop.
