/**
 * The package contains the code for an online store where users can 
 * purchase or rent movies. 
 * 
 * The code in this package is a reworked version of the example code 
 * in <code>Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing Code</code>
 * by Martin Fowler. For information about the book, see 
 * https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html.
 * 
 * The example has been updated so that it covers online digital 
 * movies that can be rented or purchased. The Transaction class 
 * has been introduced as a replacement for Rental in the original 
 * code. 
 * 
 * Please note that the code does not contain a main method. We aren't 
 * going to run the code as an application. However we will run the 
 * code via a set of tests. See the tests package also in this project.
